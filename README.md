Deploy link: [Character Creator](https://anngineer.github.io/character-creator/).

This repository uses the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to guide a new player through building a character.

## Details

This project was built with React components in VSCode using HTML, SCSS/CSS, vanilla JavaScript, JSX, and the Semantic UI React framework. Additional packages used include React Router Dom, React Media, and Axios. Wireframes and mock-ups for the design were sketched using InVision Studio. The character, background image, and icons are licensed from Envato Elements.
